# Brewbase

A toy project for tracking homebrew batches written using Elixir/Phoenix
with a GraphQL API and likely React front end.

## TODO

* Test cases - any of them.  Particularly user and auth at the moment.
* Make some models
* Make the API

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
